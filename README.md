Project Planning

Before starting a project pause for a while and brainstorm atleast three project ideas that are inspired by your own life.

User Stories 
Small scenario from user's perspective. Brief, simple and informal.

Three core elements
USER STORY:
Describe a single scenario from the user's perspective.
As a USER, I WANT to receive an.. SO THAT.

USE CASE:
Title: What is the goal?
Actor: Who desires it?
Scenario: How is it accomplished?

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
The requirements act as a checklist to ensure the application meets all
necessary functionalities. Capture the capabilities and limitations of an application.

User story ----> Use Cases ----> Requirements

ARCHITECTURE
Organise and structure the code for the application. Nouns help identify potential objects.

Behavious and responsibilities are determined by extracting simplified verb phrases fromthe requirements.

API
It's important to use actively maintatined libraries when working with APIs since they can change over time.

REST API: Used to retrieve and modify resource and data on remote systems.
